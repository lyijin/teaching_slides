Progamming 101
==============
When I was a postdoc in 2014, I cobbled these up to introduce the joys (really) of programming to PhD students in my lab + other interested students from a lab we collaborated extensively with.

(And less altruistically, I used this as a way to practice my "teaching" skills.)

These slides was targeted at people with 0 programming knowledge. Some of them ended up mastering the command line and R, of course mostly due to their own efforts, but I'd like to think I was the initial neutron that started off the chain reaction.

If the jokes in the slides sound outdated to you, they definitely are!
