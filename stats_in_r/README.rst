Stats in R

My class was split into two halves: the morning bit focused on the statistical tests that I use frequently (e.g. t-tests, Fisher's exact test, multiple testing correction...).

Later in the afternoon, I led a practical class that carried out a mock transcriptomics analysis, without assuming that students had any sort of knowledge of the UNIX command line. These files are all in the ``example`` folder.

If you'd like to replicate the analysis, note that you need to uncompress the FASTA file (``aiptasia_cds.fa.gz``), and the FASTQ files in ``example/ngs_reads``.
